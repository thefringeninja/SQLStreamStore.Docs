# SQL Server Storage

For operational reasons, you should familiarize yourself with the underlying
database schema. The schema is implemented as two tables, `Streams` and
`Messages`, and a number of indexes.

The `Streams` table contains the collection of unique streams in the store. As
stream Ids are strings there are a number of optimisations applied:

1. The original stream Id is stored in column `IdOriginal` and limited to 1000
   characters.

2. When a stream is appended for first time is it checked to see if it is
   parsable as a `Guid`. If so, then that is stored in the `Id` column. If not
   then a `Sha1` hash of the Id is generated and used. This helps with stream
   lookups and the Id unique index constraint.

3. An `IdInternal` identity column is used for joins with the messages table.

Please refer to `CreateSchema.sql` for full schema details.
